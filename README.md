# Hurricane Analysis Project

This is the finished CodeAcademy project for manipulating and creating dictionaries for a list of given data on a hurricane's attributes. The steps included for the project were:
1. Convert string values in the `damages` list into float values and update into a new list, leaving any value that says `Damages not recorded` unchanged. 
2. Create a dictionary from the lists given with the key being the name of the hurrican and the values being a dictionary with the key describine what the values are.
3. Create a dictionary from the list given, but change the key value to be the year the hurricane occured
4. Create a dictionary that contains the information of areas affected and their count. With the key being the area, and the values the count.
5. Write a function to display the area most affected and the amount of times it was affected
6. Create a dictionary that contains the rate of mortality from a given set of bounds from 0-4. With the key being the scale and the values the name of the hurricane.
7. Write a function that displays the hurricane that cost the most amount of damages.
8. reate a dictionary that contains the rate of damage from a given set of bounds from 0-4. With the key being the scale and the values the name of the hurricane.
